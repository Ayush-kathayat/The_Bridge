## The Bridge
In this project I have first Batch Minted 5 NFT's  and then deployed it to the Sepolia testnet and after this i have simply bridged it over to the Polygon chain by using FXPortal bridge.
For the NFT images I have used the DAllE and stored the imaged in the IPFS (Inter planetary file System) through Pinata.
And I have also stored the NFT Metadata in the IPFS.
